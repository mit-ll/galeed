error[E0038]: the trait `Foo` cannot be made into an object

   |       --- this trait cannot be made into an object...
LL |     fn foo() {}
   |        --- ...because associated function `foo` has no `self` parameter

   |                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `Foo` cannot be made into an object

LL |     fn foo() where Self: Sized {}
   |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
