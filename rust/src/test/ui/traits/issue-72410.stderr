error[E0038]: the trait `Bar` cannot be made into an object
  --> $DIR/issue-72410.rs:14:19
   |
LL | pub trait Bar {
   |           --- this trait cannot be made into an object...
LL |     fn map()
   |        --- ...because associated function `map` has no `self` parameter
LL |     where for<'a> &'a mut [dyn Bar]: ;
   |                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `Bar` cannot be made into an object
   |
help: consider turning `map` into a method by giving it a `&self` argument or constraining it so it does not apply to trait objects
   |
LL |     where for<'a> &'a mut [dyn Bar]:, Self: Sized ;
   |                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
